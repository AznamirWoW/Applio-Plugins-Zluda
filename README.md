# Applio Plugins

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We've just launched our new plugin system and we're looking for your assistance in creating amazing plugins! Below, you'll find all the information you need to get started.

Welcome to **Applio Plugins**, a repository specifically designed for Applio plugins.

If you're not familiar with Applio, check it out on our incredible webpage, [applio.org](https://applio.org), or visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio).

## Instructions

- The core of the plugin lies in the `def applio_plugin()` function, acting as the interface for the Gradio tab. *This function will be brought into the plugins tab later on.*
- It's crucial to maintain the original names of both the function and the `plugin.py` file, as they are integral to the import process. 

*Additionally, there's a requirements file that cannot be relocated or renamed but can be removed if not needed.*
